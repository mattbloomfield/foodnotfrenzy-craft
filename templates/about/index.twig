        <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-800">
            <p class="text-xl font-serif italic text-warm-brown mb-8">
                Every revolution begins with a breaking point. Ours came on a Tuesday evening in the midst of a downpour.
            </p>

            <div class="mb-10">
                <img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="A dimly lit kitchen with a frustrated cook" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center italic">The moment that sparked our revolution</p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-6">
                I still remember it vividly. Three hungry children, a spouse working late, and a desperate need to get dinner on the table. The rain hammered against the kitchen window as I frantically searched for a simple pasta recipe. What I found was digital violence.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Seventeen paragraphs about someone's summer in Tuscany. Four auto-play videos. A newsletter signup form that consumed half my screen. Then, just as the recipe finally came into view—a full-page ad for weight loss supplements exploded across my device, sending me back to the top of the page.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Something inside me shattered. I slammed my tablet down, hard enough that a hairline fracture appeared across its screen—a physical manifestation of my broken patience. In that moment, as my children stared wide-eyed from the doorway, I made a vow through clenched teeth: <span class="font-medium">"This ends now."</span>
            </p>

            <blockquote class="bg-soft-pink bg-opacity-20 border-l-4 border-deep-rose p-4 italic my-8">
                "The internet had weaponized our most basic human need—to feed ourselves and those we love—against us. Each recipe had become a battleground where our attention was the spoil of war."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-6">
                That night, after serving a meal cobbled together from pantry remnants, I reached out to fellow parents, home cooks, and food enthusiasts. What emerged from our conversations was a shared trauma—the collective wounding inflicted by recipe sites that had forgotten their purpose.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Maria had missed her daughter's dance recital because she got trapped in an endless scroll of pop-ups while searching for a birthday cake recipe. James described breaking down in tears after spending forty minutes fighting through ads for a chicken soup recipe when his partner was ill. Elderly Mrs. Chen had given up cooking her family's traditional recipes because navigating modern recipe sites had become too overwhelming.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                These weren't just inconveniences. They were heartbreaking violations of the sacred act of nourishing those we love. Something fundamental was being stolen from us—our time, our patience, our joy in cooking.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-warm-brown mt-12 mb-6">The Birth of Recipe Haven</h2>

            <div class="mb-10">
                <img src="/api/placeholder/800/400" alt="A bright, welcoming kitchen with organized recipes" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center italic">Our first team meeting in 2023</p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Recipe Haven emerged from that collective pain. We assembled a small team of developers, chefs, and people who simply believed that recipes should be accessible without a fight. We pooled our savings, worked nights and weekends, and built what we wished existed.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Our mission became clear: Create a sanctuary where recipes exist to serve people, not advertisers. A place where you can find what you need quickly, without life stories, without pop-ups, without psychological manipulation.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                We vowed that no parent would miss another recital, no caregiver would shed tears of frustration, and no elder would abandon their culinary heritage because a recipe was held hostage behind a wall of ads.
            </p>

                That cracked tablet still sits on my desk—a battle scar from the day we decided to reclaim cooking from those who had weaponized it against us. It reminds me daily of what we're fighting for: the simple dignity of making a meal without a fight.
