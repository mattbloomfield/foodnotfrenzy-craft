        <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-gray-800">
            <p class="text-xl font-serif italic text-warm-brown mb-8">
                Every revolution begins with a breaking point. Ours came on a rainy Tuesday evening.
            </p>

            <div class="mb-10">
                <img src="/assets/images/about-us-hero.jpg" alt="A dimly lit kitchen with a frustrated cook" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-4">
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 text-center italic">The moment that sparked our revolution</p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-6">
                I remember it vividly. Three hungry children, a spouse working late, and dinner urgently needed. As rain hammered against the window, I searched for a simple pasta recipe. What I found was digital violence.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Seventeen paragraphs about someone's summer in Tuscany. Four auto-play videos. A newsletter popup. Then, just as the recipe came into view—a full-page ad exploded across my screen, sending me back to the top of the page.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Something inside me shattered. I slammed my tablet down hard enough to crack the screen—a physical manifestation of my broken patience. In that moment, as my children stared wide-eyed from the doorway, I vowed: <span class="font-medium">"This ends now."</span>
            </p>

            <blockquote class="bg-soft-pink bg-opacity-20 border-l-4 border-deep-rose p-4 italic my-8">
                "The internet had weaponized our most basic human need—to feed ourselves and those we love—against us."
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-6">
                That night, I reached out to fellow cooks. What emerged was a shared trauma—Maria had missed her daughter's recital because she got trapped in endless pop-ups. James broke down in tears after fighting through ads for chicken soup when his partner was ill.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                These weren't inconveniences. They were violations of the sacred act of nourishing those we love.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Food Not Frenzy emerged from that collective pain. We assembled a small team of developers and chefs who believed recipes should be accessible without a fight. We built what we wished existed.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-6">
                Our mission: Create a sanctuary where recipes exist to serve people, not advertisers. A place without life stories, pop-ups, or psychological manipulation.
